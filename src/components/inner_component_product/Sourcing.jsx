            <p>The farming of chickens involves a keen science behind it. Our chickens come from Licious-curated farms across South India. Doing away with industrial farming, our chickens are reared on a cluster of individual farms according to specifications drawn out by expert meat scientists. This facilitates natural farming methods and control on the feeds of the animals.</p>
            <p>An all-natural environment ensures a healthy and stress-free upbringing that eventually provides high-grade quality meat.</p>
            <p>Each bird is carefully checked by approved veterinary doctors, who perform ante-mortem and post-mortem inspections and certify their health and fitness for human consumption.</p>
