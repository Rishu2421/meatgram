          <p>Our chickens are sourced from Licious-curated farms across South India, following precise specifications outlined by expert meat scientists. By moving away from industrial farming, we prioritize natural farming methods and maintain control over the animals' feed. This creates a healthier and stress-free environment, resulting in high-grade quality meat.</p>
          <p>Before being made available for human consumption, every bird undergoes thorough checks conducted by approved veterinary doctors. These professionals perform both ante-mortem and post-mortem inspections, certifying the health and fitness of the chickens.</p>
          <p>In summary, we ensure the sourcing of our chickens is carefully managed, focusing on quality and adhering to rigorous standards.</p>
